      <description>My first college programming class at the University of Florida used MATLAB as its instructional language. This class gave science and engineering majors basic computing skills, and I absolutely loved it - writing programs felt like casting magic spells. I switched into the computer science degree program the next semester. However, I distinctly remember my frustration with MATLAB as a language. Why did I need to define functions in a separate file?</description>
